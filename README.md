# todomx
The [TodoMVC Classic](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) implemented with the [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix) (JS and CLJS dataflow projects).

I am doing all this stuff independently in both Javascript and ClojureScript, but think it might be useful to keep both implentations under the same repo. 

## Javascript version
[This code](https://github.com/kennytilton/todomx/tree/master/js/todomx) was just copied over untested from another repo. Create an issue if you would like it resurrected.

By the way, the code cited above includes the current best implementation of Matrix in Javascript. Look for that to get migrated to the Matrix repo when I get the hood back up on the JS version.

## ClojureScript version
This can be found here under the CLJS directory [here](https://github.com/kennytilton/todomx/tree/master/cljs/todomx).
