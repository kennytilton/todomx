# todomx
The [TodoMVC Classic](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) implemented with the [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix) (JS and CLJS dataflow projects).

I am doing all this stuff independently in both Javascript and ClojureScript, but think it might be useful to keep both implentations under the same repo. 

## Javascript version
[This code](https://github.com/kennytilton/todomx/tree/master/js/todomx) was just copied over untested from another repo. Create an issue if you would like it resurrected.

## ClojureScript version
This can be found here under the CLJS directory [here](https://github.com/kennytilton/todomx/tree/master/cljs/todomx).
